# DRL-PRG-T01-C01-01 — PRG-T01-C01: JavaScript Deep Dive

> **Environment Preset:** `node-vanilla` — Standard Node.js Native Runner (CommonJS/ESM)
> **100% Local IDE Mandate**: All problem solving, refactoring, and debugging must be performed natively in your IDE (VS Code / Cursor).

## Universal 6-Step Pedagogical Practice Loop
1. **คิดเองก่อนเขียน (Mental Model)**: Review the Acceptance Criteria and boundary traps before typing.
2. **ลงมือทำ (Local IDE)**: Open the source file in VS Code or Cursor and implement the logic.
3. **ทดสอบ (Automated Acceptance Testing)**: Run `npm test` or `npm run test:<qid>` in this directory.
4. **อธิบายโค้ด (AI Senior Lead PR Review)**: Articulate your algorithm and request an AI Senior Tech Lead architectural review.
5. **Refactor (Clean Architecture)**: Decouple helpers, clean code smells, and optimize hot paths while keeping tests green.
6. **เพิ่มความยาก (Progression)**: Scale up test inputs and edge cases.

## Quick Terminal Commands
```bash
# Run all acceptance test suites in this workspace
npm test

# Run tests in watch mode while editing
npm run test:watch

# Run tests for a specific question
npm run test:q01

# Request Senior Tech Lead AI PR Review (packages code & copies prompt to clipboard)
npm run review
npm run review q01

# Grade all exercises (runs visible + hidden trap tests) and sync to Notion
npm run submit
```

## Requesting an AI Architectural Review
Once your automated acceptance tests pass 100%, copy this prompt and ask Antigravity / Cursor AI:
```text
Please act as a Senior Tech Lead and conduct an Architecture & Code Craftsmanship Review on my implementation in `DRL-PRG-T01-C01-01`.
Evaluate my code across:
1. Separation of Concerns & Clean Code standards
2. State Management & Data Handling invariants
3. TypeScript typing / JSDoc precision and edge case resilience
4. Performance hot paths, algorithmic complexity, and decoupling suggestions
```
